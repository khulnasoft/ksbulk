/**
 * A component that groups statements together in batches sharing the same {@linkplain
 * BatchMode#PARTITION_KEY partition key} or {@linkplain BatchMode#REPLICA_SET replica set}.
 *
 * <p>This component can also optionally cap the created batches by either a maximum number of child
 * statements, a maximum size in bytes of actual data to be inserted, or both. Note however that the
 * heuristic used to compute the inserted data size is not 100% accurate.
 *
 * <p>Important: for this utility to work properly, statements must have their {@linkplain
 * Statement#getRoutingKey() routing key} or their {@linkplain Statement#getRoutingToken() routing
 * token} set. Furthermore, when grouping by {@link BatchMode#REPLICA_SET replica set}, it is also
 * required that they have their {@link Statement#getKeyspace() routing keyspace} set.
